    <p id="cause" class="text-center"> <br><br><br><br>Everyday, there are many refugees who do not live the same fortunate live we take for granted.
        These refugees, who had their home taken away from them, now search from country to country, hoping they can get into one, however
        most of the time they are barred from entering. Imagine your home was taken away from you. Your whole childhood life, the memories
        you had, everythiing that had to do with your hometown. You can never visit it again because it was taken from you. Now, you
        can't even start a new beginning because no one will allow you in their country. Please, be generous and click on the link above
        to donate to one site of your choosing. We greatly appreciate it.
